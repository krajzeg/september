This simple slice should print '1 2':
1
2
And the length should be 2: 2
Open-ended slice should be the same:
1
2
And the length should still be 2: 2
Out of bounds indices should be OK, so this should be '4 5':
4
5
And the length should be truncated to 2: 2
If both indices are out of bounds, the result should be empty:
And the length should be 0: 0
array[2..end] should print 2,3,4,5:
2
3
4
5
