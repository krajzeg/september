This simple slice should print '1, 2': 1, 2
And the length should be 2: 2
Open-ended slice should be the same: 1, 2
And the length should still be 2: 2
Out of bounds indices should be OK, so this should be 4, 5: 4, 5
And the length should be truncated to 2: 2
If both indices are out of bounds, the result should be empty: 
And the length should be 0: 0
If the 'to' index is less than 'from', the result is empty: 
And the length should be 0: 0
array[3..end] should be legal and print 3, 4, 5: 3, 4, 5
Negative indices should work, so this should be 2, 3, 4: 2, 3, 4
With a length of 3: 3
