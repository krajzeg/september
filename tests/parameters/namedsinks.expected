Our inventory should have 1 apple, 2 bananas and 3 cucumbers.
Apples: 1
Bananas: 2
Cucumbers: 3
Let's try again by passing the argument explicitly.
Apples: 1
Bananas: 2
Cucumbers: 3
But we shouldn't be able to pass a parameter both explicitly and implicitly.
And we aren't.
Or pass the same argument twice.
And we aren't.
Mixing named sinks with positional arguments should work.
Dactyls:  4
Eggplants:  5
Mixing named sinks with other named arguments should also work.
Dactyls:  4
Eggplants:  5
