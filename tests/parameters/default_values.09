## Simple example of a default value

simple := |required, optional = 42| {
	print(required, optional)
}

simple("The answer to life, the universe and everything is")
simple("The answer to life, the universe and everything is", "not 'cucumber'")

## More complex example - the default value is a lazy expression
## This will more commonly be used with expressions like '[]' - but this is not available yet as of 0.1-at.

print("This should print 1, 2, the default is evaluated on each call:", lazy(), lazy())
print("This should print 42 as it was explicitly provided:", lazy(42))
print("This should print 3 as the parameter is left out again:", lazy())
