This slice should print '12': 12
This should be the same: 12
Out of bounds indices should be OK: 45
If both indices are out of bounds, the result should be empty: 
If from is greater than to, the slice should be empty: 
The string[1..end] syntax should work, so this is 12345: 12345
Negative indices within slices should work, so this is 234: 234
